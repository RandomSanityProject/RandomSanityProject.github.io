  <h1>Random Sanity Project</h1>
  <p>The Random Sanity Project is a free, open source service that
  helps secure the Internet by sanity-checking sources of
  randomness. If you are a CTO or system administrator responsible for
  a security-critical web server or application running on the
  Internet you should consider using this service to alert you
  of catastrophic hardware or software failures that could completely
  compromise the security of your website or application.
  </p>
  <p>The service is in an early stage of development; I am looking for
  people willing to use it, test it, provide feedback, and maybe
  even write a little code to help make it better.
  </p>
  <h1>How it Works</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Get an array of 64 bytes from whatever source of
      cryptographically-secure randomness you are using
    </li>
    <li>Encode them as hex, and make a REST query to the randomsanity service
    </li>
    <li>The service will return 'true' if it those bytes look random
      and nobody else has submitted the same stream of bytes; otherwise
      it will return 'false'.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For example, if you are using openssl as your source of
  randomness, you could sanity-test it with this bash code:
  </p>
  <pre>
    BYTES=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
    curl http://rest.randomsanity.org/v1/q/$BYTES
  </pre>
  <p>You should see "true" as the result. Re-run the curl command with
    the same BYTES and the result will be "false", because a good
    source of randomness will never generate the same 64 bytes twice
    (with insanely high probability). See
    the <a href="details.html">details page</a> if you're curious about
    exactly what it is doing with your bytes.
  </p>
