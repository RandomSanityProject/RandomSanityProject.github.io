  <h1>How to Help</h1>
  <p>Nicer web pages would be awesome. Want to be the WebMeister for
    this project?
    Start <a href="https://github.com/RandomSanityProject/RandomSanityProject.github.io">submitting
    pull requests</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Know something about .deb or .rpm packaging? I've written a
    check-/dev/urandom-at-startup bash script that should be packaged up
    into an easy-to-install doohickey.
  </p>
  <p>Want to write some Javascript (or Python or Ruby or Rust) code to
    help programmers in those languages avoid screwing up their crypto?
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/5c6366b75ea9048d0f9447ec63f33a77">I've got some ideas...</a>
  </p>
  <p>We'll self-organize into a Slack if there is enough
    interest; until then, email me (gavinandresen, gmail.com) if you want
    to help and can't just jump right in. Fair warning: if you're
    unpleasant to work with, please find another project to "help".
