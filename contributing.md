# How to Help

Even spiffier web pages would be awesome. Want to be the WebMeister for
this project? Start [submitting pull requests](https://github.com/RandomSanityProject/RandomSanityProject.github.io).

Know something about .deb or .rpm packaging? I've written a
check-/dev/urandom-at-startup bash script that should be packaged up.

Want to write some Javascript (or Python or Ruby or Rust) code to
help programmers in those languages avoid screwing up their crypto?
[I've got some ideas...](https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/5c6366b75ea9048d0f9447ec63f33a77)

We'll self-organize into a Slack if there is enough
interest; until then, email me (gavinandresen, gmail.com) if you want
to help and can't just jump right in. Fair warning: if you're
unpleasant to work with, please find another project to "help".
